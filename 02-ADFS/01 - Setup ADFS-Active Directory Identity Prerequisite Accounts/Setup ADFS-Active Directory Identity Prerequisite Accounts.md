## Create ADFS Group Managed Service Account

The ADFS Service Group Managed Service Account is required when configuring ADFS. This account will be referenced during the ADFS setup portion of the lab. During the ADFS configuration there is an option to have the installer create one for you, however it is important that you know how to create one and ensure that it is configured to allow service login.

1. On AD-01, Click on Start and right click on Windows PowerShell.

![](images/Picture16.png)


2. Open an **elevated**** PowerShell session**. You can use PowerShell or PowerShell ISE.

![](images/Picture17.png)


3. Create a Group Managed Service Account using the script below:

```
Add-KdsRootKey â€“EffectiveTime (Get-Date).AddHours(-10);
New-ADServiceAccount FsGmsa -DNSHostName adfs.contoso.local -ServicePrincipalNames http/adfs.contoso.local
```

![](images/Picture18.png)

1. Next, we need to ensure that the new service account has permission to logon as a service, we need to configure Group Policy to allow it.

In **Administrative Tools** , open **Group Policy Management**.

![](images/Picture19.png)


2. Expand Forest: Contoso.local, Domains, and contoso.local. **Right click** on **Default Domain Policy** and click on **Edit**.

![](images/Picture20.png)

![](images/Picture23.png)

6. Enter the name of the GMSA we created, then click Ok.

![](images/Picture24.png)

7. Click Ok on the next screen.

![](images/Picture25.png)

1. Repeat steps 4-7 to add "NT SERVICE\ALL SERVICES". **Do not click Browse** on step 5, just paste NT SERVICE\ALL SERVICES and click Ok.
**NOTE: This account is only to allow the Windows Internal Database service to login for the lab. In a Production environment, you would install WID first or use a SQL Server database.**

1. Verify the account is correct and click Ok. Close all remaining Group Policy Windows.

## Add ADFS DNS CName Record

In order to resolve our ADFS Farm name, we must create a DNS record that points to our ADFS server. By default, a record will be created for each computer object, however in a HA setup there would be more than one server. That record would normally point to a Load Balancer, but for this lab we will point to our single ADFS server.

1. On AD-01, in Administrative Tools, open the DNS Management Console.

![](images/Picture27.png)

2. Expand AD-01, Forward Lookup Zones. Right click on contoso.local and click on New alias (CNAME).

![](images/Picture28.png)

3. In the Alias name field, enter adfs. In the Fully qualified domain name field, enter the FQDN of our ADFS Server ADFS-01.contoso.local. Click Ok.

![](images/Picture29.png)

4. Close out of DNS Manager.

## Prepare ADFS Certificate Template

ADFS will require SSL Certificates for deployment and communication. These certificates can be requested from any trusted Certificate Authority, or you can use your own internal Certificate Authority.

**NOTE: You will need to connect to ADCS-01 (10.100.100.11) using RDP to perform this task.

1. In Administrative Tools, open Certificate Authority.


2. Expand Contoso-AD-01-CA, right click on Certificate Templates and click on Manage.

## Create ADFS Certificate Request and Submit it

Certificates play the most critical role in securing communications between federation servers, Web Application Proxies, claims-aware applications, and Web clients. The SSL certificate is used for securing communications between federation servers and clients.

1. Using RDP from the ASDK, connect to the ADFS server ADFS-01 by its IP Address 10.100.100.12 and login with Contoso\Administrator and the password supplied by the instructor.


2. Right click on the start button and click on Run

## Prepare ADFS Certificate

During the ADFS installation, a PFX file will be required. This process will allow you to export the certificate including the private key as a PFX file. In this lab we are only using a single ADFS server and the enrolled certificate will be installed on, however in a production environment you would have multiple ADFS servers in your farm. The PFX file you export in this process would need to be imported on each ADFS server in your farm. See [install-the-new-ssl-certificate-on-each-federation-server-in-the-ad-fs-farm](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-R2-and-2012/dn781428(v=ws.11)%23install-the-new-ssl-certificate-on-each-federation-server-in-the-ad-fs-farm) for more details.
